                            The project Smart-City-Transportation serves the basic need of managing information management in the field of transportation. It is a common experience of every individual that in big cities of India, commutation within and outside the city can be very chaotic if the information such as distance, average time etc. about a forthcoming journey is unknown. This results in loss of valuable resources like time, money etc., And if there is any source of information then the expected problem can be prepared for in advance.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The primary object of devising this system is to provide real time information to an individual about the transporting facilities available inside and outside the city. This project manages the information available completely and effectively so that the user needs minimum time to reach and extract the required information. Also this project aims to be user friendly, that is to say, it does not require any great expertise to operate this system. The project aims to capture the information available or that can be made available at a single point, this in itself is a great help to those seeking such information especially to those who are new into the city. Also this system can implemented, with little change in databases, so that it can work for any city across the country. When people move from one city to another city it is often noticed that they do not have any adequate knowledge of even the most prominent sites of the city, let alone the ?not-so-known? sites of the city.
                            One of the main objectives of this system is to divide the information of the transportation into small and manageable modules so that the user can reach the required information within small time and utilize it.
